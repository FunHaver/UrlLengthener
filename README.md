# URL Lengthener

A Flask-based url lengthening microservice.

## Purpose
This project is my first full stack program! I followed the spec from this freeCodeCamp project [here](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/url-shortener-microservice).

### Technologies used:
1. Flask (a Python based microframework)
2. Postgresql
3. HTML
4. CSS
5. Heroku

## Usage

Visit [this link](https://murmuring-escarpment-42190.herokuapp.com), then type in the url you would like to make longer.

The program will give you the link in JSON format. This lengthened link will automatically redirect you to the site you had typed in originally.
